# charity-water-Landing-Page

A landing page for the charity: water organization that tries to appeal to college students to donate to their cause. 

Simply download the repository into a folder and click the HTML file to interact with the page. 

**Project Details**:

This project involved taking into account the given customer personas of college students being socially aware and wanting to make a change in the world. We also needed to create a value proposition that aligns with not only charity: water but also with the persona to attract them to donate. Using the value proposition, we made use of AI prompting to help create a well-made headline, a subheadline, and a CTA (call to action) phrase that would inspire college students to start donating to the organization for their cause. 

Value Proposition: "Everyone deserves access to clean and safe drinking water. With your help, 100% of your donation goes directly toward helping vulnerable communities thrive through access to healthy, vitalizing water. "

Using this proposition, we can prompt AI to give example headlines and subheadlines for the page, and after going through many headlines, we were able to combine the best parts of each example and create a great headline/subheadline for the page. This helped optimize the process of coming up with the best version of our headlines. 

This project went through charity: water's guidebook to see what guidelines to follow to properly represent the organization. We must take into account its color palette, typography, and how the page should be organized. We used Canva to create a mockup page of the landing page to see how it pans out. Canvas' AI image generator was also used to come up with a hero image for the page. 

Once the Canva page was finalized, it was used as a reference for HTML and CSS to bring the mockup page to life.
